### IMPORTANT:

- Upload your word list to words.txt (separators are space and \n)

- Use start.bat to launch

- Before starting, make sure your Python interpreter is added to PATH

- If you encounter Python interpreter errors, change "python" in the last line of start.bat to your current interpreter (with full path)
